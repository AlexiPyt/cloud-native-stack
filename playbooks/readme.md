## Systems support 
The following systems are support for Cloud Native Stack:

- You have [NVIDIA-Certified Systems](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-deploy-on-premises/nvidia-certified-systems/index.html) with Mellanox CX NICs for x86-64 servers 
- You have [NVIDIA Qualified Systems](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/data-center-gpus/qualified-system-catalog/?start=0&count=50&pageNumber=1&filters=eyJmaWx0ZXJzIjpbXSwic3ViRmlsdGVycyI6eyJwcm9jZXNzb3JUeXBlIjpbIkFSTS1UaHVuZGVyWDIiLCJBUk0tQWx0cmEiXX0sImNlcnRpZmllZEZpbHRlcnMiOnt9LCJwYXlsb2FkIjpbXX0=) for arm64 servers 
  `NOTE:` For ARM systems, NVIDIA Network Operator is not supported yet. 
- You have [NVIDIA Jetson Systems](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/)

To determine if your system qualifies as an NVIDIA Certified System, review the list of NVIDIA Certified Systems [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-deploy-on-premises/nvidia-certified-systems/index.html). 

Please note that NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack is validated only on systems with the default kernel (not HWE).

### Installing the Ubuntu Operating System
These instructions require Ubuntu server please reference the [Ubuntu Server Installation Guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-install-ubuntu-server#1-overview).

### Installing JetPack for Jetson 

JetPack (the Jetson SDK) is an on-demand all-in-one package that bundles developer software for the NVIDIAÂ® Jetson platform. There are two ways to install the JetPack 

1. Use the SDK Manager installer to flash your Jetson Developer Kit with the latest OS image, install developer tools for both host PC and Developer Kit, and install the libraries and APIs, samples, and documentation needed to jump-start your development environment.

Follow the [instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/sdk-manager/install-with-sdkm-jetson/index.html) on how to install JetPack 5.0There are two ways to install the JetPack 

Download the SDK Manager from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-sdk-manager)

2. Use the SD Card Image method to download the JetPack and load the OS image to external drive. For more information, please refer [flash using SD Card method](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-xavier-nx-devkit#prepare)

```

Install the NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack stack by running the below command. "Skipping" in the ansible output refers to the Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
```
bash setup.sh install
```
#### Custom Configuration
By default Cloud Native Stack uses Google kubernetes apt repository, if you want to use any other kubernetes apt repository, please adjust the `k8s_apt_key` and `k8s_apt_repository` in `cnc_values_<version>.yaml`.

Example:
```

## Kubernetes apt resources
k8s_apt_key: "https://mirrors.aliyun.com/kubernetes/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg"
k8s_apt_repository: "deb https://mirrors.aliyun.com/kubernetes/apt/ kubernetes-xenial main"
k8s_registry: "registry.aliyuncs.com/google_containers"
```

### Validation

Run the below command to check if the installed versions are match with predefined versions of the NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack. Here' "Ignored" tasks refer to failed and "Changed/Ok" tasks refer to success.

Run the validation playbook after 5 minutes once completing the NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack Installation. Depends on your internet speed, you need to wait more time.

```
bash setup.sh validate
```
### Upgrade 

Cloud Native Stack can be support life cycle management with upgrade option. you can upgrade the current running stack version to next available version. 

Upgrade option is available from one minor version to next minor version of CNS.

Example: Cloud Native Stack 8.0 can upgrade to 8.1 but 8.x can not upgrade to 9.x

### Uninstall

Run the below command to uninstall the NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack. Tasks being "ignored" refers to no kubernetes cluster being available.

```
bash setup.sh uninstall
```
