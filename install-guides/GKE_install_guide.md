# GKE(Google Kubernetes Engine) with Cloud Native Stack

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling your containerized applications using Google infrastructure. NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack is supported to run on GKE. The GKE environment consists of multiple machines (specifically, [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) instances) grouped together to form a [cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-architecture). This guide provides details for deploying and running NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack on GKE clusters with NVIDIA GPU Accelerated nodes.
